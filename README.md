Here, I will post all free SQL questions


### Limit and Offset
Limit will give you how many you want to extract, and offset will give you from where you want to extract.

LIMIT basically means how much records u are extracting
OFFSET means from which record you want extraction ( 0 means from first, 1 means from second record.........)
LIMIT 1,N means means LIMIT is N and OFFSET is 1
LIMIT N,1 means LIMIT is 1 and OFFSET is N
LIMIT 1 OFFSET N is same as first one

LIMIT M, 1
is equivalent to
LIMIT 1 OFFSET M
